class PlotResponsibilityChainBase(ABC):
    """
    Base class for implementing the responsibility chain pattern for plotting.

    This class provides a framework for creating a chain of plotting handlers where
    each handler can decide whether it can handle a specific plot request. If a handler
    cannot process the request, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain.
    All plotting chain implementations should inherit from this class and implement
    the _can_plot and _plot methods.

        Attempts to plot data by finding an appropriate handler in the chain.

        Parameters:
            data (dict): Dictionary containing 'key' identifying the plot type
